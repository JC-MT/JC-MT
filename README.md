## About me

Currently, I'm in a year long intensive Full-Stack Fellowship at _[Pursuit](https://www.pursuit.org/mission-vision)_ in Long Island City, NY. In the last 8 months, I've developed a deep understanding and skill of the tools you'll see below and I'm excited to continue learning cool stuff.

- 🌱 Currently, learning about Data Structures and Algorithms

- 🥲 Fun fact: I was once lost in a dessert for ~36 hours and rescued by complete strangers
